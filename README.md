# Machine Learning: a Case Study Approach

This repository contains exercises that I completed as part of the University 
of Washington course "Machine Learning: a Case Study Approach". This course 
covers the fundamentals of machine learning and its practical applications 
through real-world case studies. It also provides an introduction to data 
analysis using the Python programming language and popular machine learning 
libraries such as Scikit-learn.

## People Wiki

The `People Wiki` directory contains an exercise where I:

- Used Pandas to analyze a dataset of people and their associated Wikipedia 
pages.
- Learned how to use Pandas to generate statistics and gain insights into the 
data.
- Found the most common words used in the Wikipedia pages, and explored the 
relationship between the length of the Wikipedia page and the person's 
profession.
- Developed my skills in data cleaning and visualization.

## Predicting House Prices

The `Predicting House Prices` directory contains an exercise where I:

- Applied machine learning techniques to predict the prices of houses in a 
dataset based on their features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and 
square footage.
- Preprocessed the data and trained various regression models using 
Scikit-learn.
- Developed my skills in feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

Overall, this course and these exercises provided a solid foundation in 
machine learning and data analysis, and helped me to develop practical skills 
that I can apply in real-world projects.
